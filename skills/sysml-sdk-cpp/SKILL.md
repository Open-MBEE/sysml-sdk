description: Writes C++17 code that reads, navigates and queries SysML v2 and KerML models with the header-only sysml SDK (namespace sysml, <sysml/classes.g.hpp>), through the OpenMBEE SysML Toolkit (a native binding library loaded at run time) or from a full-form interchange JSON payload. Use when a task involves loading .sysml/.kerml files or SysML v2 JSON in C++, walking parts, features, states, connections or requirements, evaluating a model's expressions, or answering questions about a SysML v2 model with code.

# SysML v2 SDK for C++

The SDK is the OMG metamodel as C++ structs: every KerML and SysML metaclass, property and
operation, under its specification name, with the metaclass hierarchy as virtual inheritance over
one runtime `Element`. Header-only, C++17, JSON through the bundled nlohmann/json. A model comes from
one of two backends:

- **the SysML Toolkit**, through its native binding library, loaded at run time: reads SysML text,
  resolves names, computes derived properties and evaluates operations, and refuses what it cannot
  derive completely;
- **a payload**: a full-form interchange JSON export from any SysML v2 tool.

The SDK never guesses. A member the SysML Toolkit does not answer throws
`not_implemented_in_toolkit` with the reason the SysML Toolkit gives; a reference that does not
resolve throws `unresolved_reference`. Never catch these to substitute a made-up value; read
around them as described below, or report them.

## Setup

```sh
g++ -std=c++17 -I sysml-sdk-cpp-0.1.0/include main.cpp -o main   # add -ldl on Linux, -static with MinGW
```

- The package `sysml-sdk-cpp-0.1.0.zip` has `include/` with `sysml/` and `nlohmann/`.
- For the SysML Toolkit, the archive's `lib/<target>/` holds the binding library for Windows x64,
  Linux x64, and macOS on Apple silicon and on Intel: copy the one for your platform beside your
  executable, where `ToolkitBackend::open` finds it. To load it from elsewhere, set `SYSMLV2_ABI` to
  it, or name it in code: pass `std::make_shared<ToolkitBackend::Library>(path)` as the last
  argument of `ToolkitBackend::open`.
- The release's `sysml_library-0.1.0.zip` is the standard library: `sysml.library/` (the models,
  for the SysML Toolkit) and `sysml.library.full.json` (for payloads).

Costs: `classes.g.hpp` is about 4 MB, so a translation unit that includes it takes tens of seconds
to compile: keep the SDK in one translation unit (or a precompiled header). Opening a model with the
standard library takes one to three seconds; the SysML Toolkit's JSON export of a model takes a few
seconds; parsing the 160 MB library JSON takes tens of seconds (parse it once). A model that does
not load, or a model file or library directory that does not exist, throws `sdk_error` with a
status; the SysML Toolkit's reason (the missing path, a parse error) is printed on stderr.

## Loading a model

`<sysml/classes.g.hpp>` includes the runtime (`<sysml/sdk.hpp>`, which alone has no
metaclasses): include it, and `<sysml/toolkit.hpp>` for the SysML Toolkit.

Through the SysML Toolkit:

```cpp
#include <sysml/classes.g.hpp>   // the runtime and every metaclass (always include it)
#include <sysml/toolkit.hpp>     // the SysML Toolkit backend
using namespace sysml;

int main() {
    Model model = Model::from_backend(ToolkitBackend::open(
        {"model.sysml"},           // your files
        {},                        // or in-memory sources: {{"m.sysml", text}}
        "sysml.library"));         // the standard library directory
    // ... your code here ...
}
```

From a payload (a JSON export you have):

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <sstream>
#include <sysml/classes.g.hpp>
using namespace sysml;

static std::string read_file(const std::string& path) {
    std::ifstream in(path, std::ios::binary);
    std::stringstream text;
    text << in.rdbuf();
    return text.str();
}

int main() {
    auto library = PayloadLibrary::parse(read_file("sysml.library.full.json"));   // once; a shared_ptr to share
    Model model = Model::from_full_json(read_file("model.json"), library);
    // ... your code here ...
}
```

Load the standard library whenever the model uses it, which nearly every model does
(`ScalarValues::Real`, `ISQ::mass`, and implicitly `Parts::parts`). Without it, references into the
library stay unresolved: harmless until you read one, then `unresolved_reference`.
(`ToolkitBackend::open({"a.sysml"})` and `ToolkitBackend::open_sources({{"m.sysml", text}})` open
without it.) Relative paths are relative to the working directory. Element ids depend on the file
names given. With sources given, paths are ignored. Elements keep their model alive; copy them
freely. The SDK takes JSON as text, not paths.

A payload refers to the standard library's elements without containing them; pass the library JSON
and those references resolve. Library elements are not the model's (`all()`, `roots()`,
`elements_of_type<T>()` skip them); a qualified name is looked up in the payload first. The library
JSON lists each library element's own members only, not what it inherits.

## The shape of the API

- **Find:** `model.resolve("Pkg::Part::feature")` returns `std::optional<Element>`; convert with
  `.value().as<PartDefinition>()`. `model.elements_of_type<PartUsage>()` (subclasses included),
  `model.all()`, `model.roots()` (top-level namespaces; the packages are their
  `getOwnedMember()`). `model.resolve` is the SysML Toolkit's own name lookup: it also finds
  inherited members and members of a feature's type (`"EBikes::CargoEBike::wheels"` is
  `Bike::wheels`), and it answers where the specification's `resolve` operation is refused.
- **Properties** are getters, `get` + the specification name: `getQualifiedName()`,
  `getOwnedFeature()`, `getIsComposite()`. **Operations** keep their names: `effectiveName()`,
  `resolve("Name")` on a `Namespace`.
- **Results:** a multi-valued property is `std::vector<T>` (empty when absent); a single-valued one
  `std::optional<T>`: `std::optional<std::string>`, `std::optional<bool>`,
  `std::optional<std::int64_t>` for Integer, `std::optional<double>` for Real, enumeration values as
  lowercase strings (`"requirement"`). `getSourceFeature()` is one optional feature,
  `getTargetFeature()` a vector. An unnamed element's `getName()` is `std::nullopt` (`entry;`, a
  `connect` without a name). An operation without a declared type returns `Value`.
- **Metaclass tests:** `el.is_a<PartUsage>()`; convert with `el.as<PartUsage>()`, which throws
  `wrong_kind` if it is not one. Never `static_cast` or `dynamic_cast` between the structs.
  `ConnectionUsage`, `InterfaceUsage` and `AllocationUsage` are `PartUsage`s too (`FlowUsage` is
  not); every connector, connections, flows, successions and bindings alike, is a
  `ConnectorAsUsage`. A definition's `getOwnedPart()` therefore lists its connections too.
  `el.metaclass_name()` is the concrete metaclass.
- **Every element** has the members of `Element`: `getName()`, `getDeclaredName()`,
  `getQualifiedName()`, `getOwner()`, `getOwningNamespace()`, `getDocumentation()`,
  `getIsLibraryElement()`, `effectiveName()`.
- **Identity:** within one model, `==` compares element ids, and `std::hash<Element>` hashes them,
  so `std::unordered_set<Element>` works (store `Element`, convert with `as<T>()` when reading). The
  same element read through two models (the SysML Toolkit's and its export's) is not `==`: compare
  their `element_id()`s.
  Runtime members are snake_case with an underscore: `element_id()`, `backend_handle()`,
  `metaclass_name()`, `get_raw(prop)`, `is_a`, `as`.
- **Errors** (all `sdk_error`, a `std::runtime_error`): `not_implemented_in_toolkit`,
  `unresolved_reference`, `gone`, `wrong_kind`. An operation argument that must be an element and is
  empty throws `std::invalid_argument`.
- **Operations** need the SysML Toolkit (a payload throws for every one) and take the
  specification's parameters in order, as `classes.g.hpp` declares them
  (`inheritedMemberships(excludedNamespaces, excludedTypes, excludeImplied)`). The SysML Toolkit has
  a body for about a third of them and answers a call only where its evidence for the model is
  complete. Answered on a typical model: `effectiveName()` (not on every unnamed feature),
  `effectiveShortName()`, `resolveGlobal`, `supertypes(true)` (the argument is `excludeImplied`),
  `evaluate(target)` (target: the element to evaluate in, such as the part usage; it returns
  elements, such as the literal a feature is bound to), `modelLevelEvaluable`. Refused there:
  `resolve`, `resolveLocal`, `resolveVisible`, `visibleMemberships`, `namesOf`,
  `inheritedMemberships`, `supertypes(false)`. No body at all: `isCompatibleWith`, `specializes`,
  `allSupertypes`, `directionOf`, ... Catch the refusal.

## When the SysML Toolkit refuses a read (read this before writing queries)

The SysML Toolkit's checked reader answers a property only where it can derive it completely. In
this release it refuses most of what builds on inheritance, so plan for it:

- **refused on nearly every element:** `getFeature()`, `getInheritedFeature()`,
  `getInheritedMembership()`, `getFeatureMembership()`, `getMember()`, `getMembership()`,
  `getImportedMembership()`, `getEndFeature()`, `getInput()`, `getOutput()`, `getUsage()`,
  `getDirectedUsage()`, `getDefinition()` and the kind-specific definitions
  (`getPartDefinition()`, `getPortDefinition()`, `getItemDefinition()`,
  `getRequirementDefinition()`, ...), `getParameter()` and `getFeaturingType()`;
- **refused on features, even with a written typing:** `getType()`. Assume it is refused and use
  `types_of` below;
- **refused on connectors, accept actions, requirements and satisfy relations:**
  `getSourceFeature()`, `getTargetFeature()`, `getConnectorEnd()`, `getRelatedFeature()`,
  `getPayloadParameter()`, `getSubjectParameter()`, `getActorParameter()`,
  `getStakeholderParameter()`, `getSatisfyingFeature()`;
- **answered:** what the model states itself: `getOwnedMember()`, `getOwnedFeature()`,
  `getOwnedMembership()`, the owned lists (`getOwnedUsage()`, `getOwnedPart()`, `getNestedUsage()`,
  `getNestedPart()`, `getNestedAttribute()`, `getNestedState()`, `getNestedTransition()`, ...; owned
  members only, so an empty `getNestedPart()` does not mean a usage has no parts), `getOwner()`,
  `getOwningNamespace()`, `getOwningType()`, `getName()`, `getDeclaredName()`,
  `getQualifiedName()`, `getDocumentation()`, `getMultiplicity()`, `getDirection()`,
  `getIsComposite()`, `getIsEnd()`, `getIsImplied()`, `getEntryAction()`, `getIsParallel()`,
  `getTriggerAction()`, a transition's `getSource()` and `getTarget()`,
  `getSatisfiedRequirement()`, `getChainingFeature()`, and the specific owned relationships with
  their ends: `getOwnedTyping()` (`getType()`), `getOwnedSubclassification()`
  (`getSuperclassifier()`), `getOwnedSpecialization()` (`getGeneral()`), `getOwnedSubsetting()`
  (`getSubsettedFeature()`; it holds the redefinitions too), `getOwnedRedefinition()`
  (`getRedefinedFeature()`), `getOwnedReferenceSubsetting()` (`getReferencedFeature()`), and a port
  definition's `getConjugatedPortDefinition()` / `getOriginalPortDefinition()`.
  (`getOwnedMember()`, `getOwnedFeature()` and `getOwnedMembership()` are refused on a
  `FeatureReferenceExpression`.)

The refusal's message names the member and the SysML Toolkit's reason (`property has an incomplete
derivation`, `Type features are incomplete: IncompleteProvider`, `incomplete operation evidence`):
the SysML Toolkit lacks complete evidence for that element, which says nothing about whether the
model is right. Whether a read is refused depends on the property and the element; try one element
first rather than assume. Where it is refused, in this order:

**1. Read what the model states.** The helpers below derive what the common refused properties
give, from the owned relationships (verified through the SysML Toolkit and through the export alike;
copy them as they are, after the SDK's includes and `using namespace sysml;`). `getIsImplied()`
marks the relationships the SysML Toolkit adds from the library, which the model does not write.

**2. Query the SysML Toolkit's export as a payload** when a question needs the specification's full
derivation across a whole model (inherited members with visibility and imports, connector ends of
library connections). The export is written by the SysML Toolkit's compatibility path: it carries a
value for every property, including the ones the checked reader refuses, which the SysML Toolkit
does not vouch for. Say so in your answer when the result depends on them. `full_json` belongs to
the backend, so take it before handing the backend to a model:

```cpp
auto library = PayloadLibrary::parse(read_file("sysml.library.full.json"));   // once; read_file as above
auto backend = ToolkitBackend::open({"model.sysml"}, {}, "sysml.library");
Model exported = Model::from_full_json(backend->full_json(), library);   // same element ids as the SysML Toolkit's
Model model = Model::from_backend(std::move(backend));                    // the same session
```

**3. Never** substitute an empty vector, a guess or a default for a refused read.

## Navigation recipes

With the helpers above; each works through the SysML Toolkit and on a payload.

```cpp
// d, part, port, usage, flow, machine and constraint stand for elements you have at hand (d: a
// definition or usage, as a Type); model is the Model.

// Parts of a definition or usage, owned and inherited, not connections; the model's own, not the
// library's (start, done, subparts, ...)
std::vector<PartUsage> parts;
for (const Feature& f : features_with_inherited(d))
    if (f.is_a<PartUsage>() && !f.is_a<ConnectionUsage>()) parts.push_back(f.as<PartUsage>());

std::vector<Type> definitions = types_of(part);      // what a usage is typed by

// The value a feature has in a context (`attribute :>> mass = 2.5;` in the part's definition or body)
Feature mass_f = model.resolve("Pkg::Component::mass").value().as<Feature>();   // the declaration; declaration_of(f) finds it from a redefinition
std::optional<Expression> expr = bound_value(part, mass_f);
double mass = number(expr.value());                  // a literal, or a sign applied to one (-40.0)

Bounds b = multiplicity_of(usage);                   // {2, 2} for [2]; {1, 1} by default; upper empty for *
std::string text = b.first == b.second ? "[" + std::to_string(*b.first) + "]"
    : "[" + std::to_string(b.first.value_or(0)) + ".." + (b.second ? std::to_string(*b.second) : "*") + "]";

// Roll-up: an attribute summed over a definition's direct parts (mass, cost, power); for a deeper
// tree, apply it to each part that has parts of its own (features_with_inherited(p))
double total = 0;
std::vector<std::string> missing;
for (const PartUsage& p : parts) {
    std::optional<Expression> e = bound_value(p, mass_f);
    Bounds n = multiplicity_of(p);
    if (!e || !n.second || n.first != n.second) missing.push_back(p.getName().value_or("?"));   // no value, or a range ([4..6], *): report, never guess
    else total += number(*e) * static_cast<double>(*n.second);
}

// Ports: the definition, and whether it is conjugated (`port p : ~PowerPort;`). getPortDefinition()
// (a vector) is refused; getIsConjugated() is false on a `~` port: the conjugation is its type, the
// ConjugatedPortDefinition that PowerPort owns (name "~PowerPort", qualified name
// "Pkg::PowerPort::'~PowerPort'", quotes included)
for (const Type& t : types_of(port))
    std::cout << (t.is_a<ConjugatedPortDefinition>()
        ? "~" + t.as<ConjugatedPortDefinition>().getOriginalPortDefinition().value().getQualifiedName().value_or("")
        : t.getQualifiedName().value_or("")) << "\n";

// Connections (ConnectionUsage: connect, interfaces, allocations): the ends, the source first. The
// ends of an inherited connection are the supertype's features (Drone::rotors, not a redefining
// `part :>> rotors[8];`): feature_in(d, chain.front()) is the one that stands for it in d
for (const Feature& f : features_with_inherited(d))
    if (f.is_a<ConnectionUsage>())
        for (const Feature& end : ends(f.as<ConnectionUsage>())) {
            std::vector<Feature> chain = path(end);          // [battery, powerOut], then the target
            std::vector<Type> port_types = types_of(chain.back());   // [PortDefinition or ConjugatedPortDefinition]
        }
// Flows (FlowUsage), bindings (BindingConnectorAsUsage) and successions are ConnectorAsUsage too,
// with the same ends()
std::vector<Classifier> items = flow.as<FlowUsage>().getPayloadType();   // the flowing item's definition

// States
StateUsage machine = model.resolve("Pkg::Controller::modes").value().as<StateUsage>();   // e.g. an ExhibitStateUsage
std::vector<StateUsage> states = machine.getNestedState();   // its own states
std::vector<StateUsage> initial = initial_states(machine);   // `entry; then off;`, `first start then off;`, ...

for (const TransitionUsage& t : machine.getNestedTransition()) {
    ActionUsage from = t.getSource().value();   // getSource(), getTarget(): std::optional<ActionUsage>; the
    ActionUsage to = t.getTarget().value();     // states (as<StateUsage>()); an initial transition
    // (`transition init then off;`) leaves the entry action, not a state: no as<StateUsage>() then
    std::vector<Type> signals = t.getTriggerAction().empty() ? std::vector<Type>{} : accepted_types(t.getTriggerAction().at(0));
}

// Requirements
for (const SatisfyRequirementUsage& s : model.elements_of_type<SatisfyRequirementUsage>()) {
    RequirementUsage req = s.getSatisfiedRequirement().value();
    std::optional<Feature> by = satisfying_feature(s);            // the part that satisfies it
    std::vector<Type> definition = types_of(req);                 // [RequirementDefinition]
    std::optional<Usage> subject = subject_of(req);               // its subject parameter; often the definition's
                                                                  // (`subject bike : Bike;` in MassLimit: MassLimit::bike)
    std::optional<Feature> limit_f;                               // the definition's maxMass
    for (const Type& t : types_of(req))
        for (const Feature& f : features_with_inherited(t))
            if (f.getName() == std::optional<std::string>("maxMass")) limit_f = f;
    std::optional<Expression> limit = bound_value(req, limit_f.value());   // the requirement's value for it
    std::vector<ConstraintUsage> constraints;                     // its own constraints
    for (const Membership& m : req.getOwnedMembership())
        if (m.is_a<RequirementConstraintMembership>()
            && m.as<RequirementConstraintMembership>().getKind() == std::optional<std::string>("requirement"))
            constraints.push_back(m.as<RequirementConstraintMembership>().getOwnedConstraint().value());
}
```

## Multiplicity

`getMultiplicity()` is only what the usage itself declares; `multiplicity_of` above applies SysML's
rule: a usage without one takes the multiplicity of the features it redefines or subsets as written
(nearest first; `part :>> battery[2];` declares its own), and one that redefines or subsets nothing
is `[1..1]` if it is an attribute, item, part or port usage owned by a definition or usage, and
unconstrained (`[0..*]`) otherwise. Implied subsettings (`getIsImplied()`, such as every part's
subsetting of the library's `parts`) do not count. A bound may be an expression to evaluate in
context (`Rotor[rotorCount]`); `bounds` throws for it.

## Evaluating the model's expressions

Expressions are elements: `OperatorExpression` (`getOperator()` such as `"<="`, `"and"`, `"not"`;
`getArgument()`), `FeatureReferenceExpression` (`getReferent()`), `FeatureChainExpression` (`a.b`:
argument 0 is `a`, `getTargetFeature()` is `b`; it is an OperatorExpression too, so test it first),
literals with `getValue()` (`LiteralInteger`, `LiteralRational`, `LiteralBoolean`, `LiteralString`,
`LiteralInfinity` for `*`), `TriggerInvocationExpression` (`getKind()`: `at`, `after`, `when`). An
enumeration literal is an `EnumerationUsage` whose `getOwningNamespace()` is the
`EnumerationDefinition` (its owning type is empty, by the specification). Through the SysML Toolkit,
`getArgument()` is refused: an expression's operands are its `getOwnedFeature()`s, each bound by a
`FeatureValue` in its `getOwnedMembership()`.

The SysML Toolkit's `evaluate(target)` operation evaluates some expressions (it returns elements);
beyond that, the SDK does not evaluate. The SDK's source repository
(https://github.com/Open-MBEE/sysml-sdk, not the release packages) has, in
`examples/queries/cpp/queries.hpp`, an evaluator in three-valued logic (values as
`std::variant<Unknown, bool, double, std::string, Element>`) and complete queries: reachable states
with shortest trigger sequences, bill of materials, attribute roll-up, connectivity, requirement
checks. Where it is at hand, start from it for such questions; the recipes above cover the simple
cases. In C++17 a `std::variant` holding both `bool` and `std::string` takes a string literal as
`bool`: construct strings explicitly.

## Other differences from the specification

- **With the library loaded**, `getUsage()`/`getFeature()` (in a payload) include library features:
  filter with `getIsLibraryElement()`. A flow's `getConnectorEnd()` also lists the library flow's
  ends; use `ends`.
- The second operand of `and`/`or`/`implies` is the operand expression itself, not the
  `FeatureReferenceExpression` to it that the specification builds. Accept both.
- An unnamed `satisfy` has no name, but a qualified-name lookup may still find it under the name of
  the requirement it satisfies. A feature named only through what it redefines has `getName()` from
  it and `getDeclaredName()` `std::nullopt` (a satisfy's subject parameter is named `subj`, although
  it redefines the subject of the requirement's definition).
- `getMayTimeVary()`, `getIsVariable()` and `getIsConstant()` on usages throw
  `not_implemented_in_toolkit`.
- In the SysML Toolkit's export, an alias (`alias ax for x;`) hides the membership of the feature it
  names from what specializations inherit, and a conjugated port's `getPortDefinition()` is the
  `ConjugatedPortDefinition` (`~PowerPort`), as the specification says.
- A payload answers what its writer wrote: stand-ins where the writer had no value (empty, `false`,
  an empty vector), and `unresolved_reference` for references into the
  standard library unless it was given the library JSON.

## Verify

- Run the same query through the SysML Toolkit (with the helpers) and on its export as a payload
  (the plain derived properties), matching elements by `element_id()`; differences point at the
  SysML Toolkit, the export, or your code.
- Format numbers with `snprintf` in the C locale; `std::to_chars` for floating point is missing on
  older macOS deployment targets.
- For more examples: the guide and runnable tutorial (`examples/cpp/`) and the query examples
  (`examples/queries/cpp/`) in the SDK repository.
