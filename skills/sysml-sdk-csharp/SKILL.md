name: sysml-sdk-csharp
description: Writes C# (.NET 8) code that reads, navigates and queries SysML v2 and KerML models with the OpenMBEE.SysML NuGet package, through the OpenMBEE SysML Toolkit (a native binding library) or from a full-form interchange JSON payload. Use when a task involves loading .sysml/.kerml files or SysML v2 JSON in C#, walking parts, features, states, connections or requirements, evaluating a model's expressions, or answering questions about a SysML v2 model with code.

# SysML v2 SDK for C#

The SDK is the OMG metamodel as C# interfaces with default members: every KerML and SysML
metaclass, property and operation, under its specification name, with the metaclass hierarchy as
interface inheritance. A model comes from one of two backends:

- **the SysML Toolkit**, through its native binding library (P/Invoke): reads SysML text, resolves
  names, computes derived properties and evaluates operations, and refuses what it cannot derive
  completely;
- **a payload**: a full-form interchange JSON export from any SysML v2 tool, pure .NET.

The SDK never guesses. A member the SysML Toolkit does not answer throws
`NotImplementedInToolkitException` with the reason the SysML Toolkit gives; a reference that does
not resolve throws `UnresolvedReferenceException`. Never catch these to substitute a made-up
value; read around them as described below, or report them.

## Setup

```sh
dotnet add package OpenMBEE.SysML --version 0.1.0 --source <folder with the .nupkg>
```

`--source` is not saved in the project; for later restores (another machine, a cleared cache), add
a `nuget.config` beside the project:

```xml
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="sysml-sdk" value="path/to/folder-with-the-nupkg" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

- The package carries the binding library for Windows x64, Linux x64, and macOS on
  Apple silicon and on Intel; .NET puts the one for the running platform beside the program, where
  `ToolkitBackend.DefaultLibrary` finds it. To use another build, set `SYSMLV2_ABI` to it, or name it
  in code with `new ToolkitBackend.Library(path)` in place of `ToolkitBackend.DefaultLibrary` (one
  per process; it is not disposable).
- The release's `sysml_library-0.1.0.zip` is the standard library: `sysml.library/` (the models,
  for the SysML Toolkit) and `sysml.library.full.json` (for payloads).

Costs: opening a model with the standard library takes one to three seconds; the SysML Toolkit's
JSON export of a model takes a few seconds; the library JSON is about 160 MB and takes a few seconds
to read (read it once). A model file that does not exist throws `FileNotFoundException`, a library
directory `DirectoryNotFoundException`; a model that does not load throws an `SdkException` with a
status, and the SysML Toolkit's reason (a parse error) is printed on stderr.

## Loading a model

Through the SysML Toolkit:

```csharp
using OpenMBEE.SysML;
using SpecType = OpenMBEE.SysML.Type;      // the metaclass Type, beside System.Type

using var toolkit = ToolkitBackend.Open(ToolkitBackend.DefaultLibrary,   // the package's binding library, or SYSMLV2_ABI's
    new[] { "model.sysml" },                          // your files; Array.Empty<string>() with sources
    null,                                             // or in-memory sources: new Dictionary<string, string> { ["m.sysml"] = text }
    "sysml.library");                                 // the standard library directory
var model = new Model(toolkit);                       // the session closes when `toolkit` is disposed
```

From a payload (a JSON export you have):

```csharp
using OpenMBEE.SysML;
using SpecType = OpenMBEE.SysML.Type;

var library = PayloadLibrary.FromJson(File.ReadAllText("sysml.library.full.json"));  // once, share it
var model = Model.FromFullJson(File.ReadAllText("model.json"), library);
```

The code here assumes the implicit usings `dotnet new console` turns on (`System`, `System.IO`,
`System.Linq`, `System.Collections.Generic`, ...). Load the standard library whenever the model uses
it, which nearly every model does (`ScalarValues::Real`, `ISQ::mass`, and implicitly
`Parts::parts`). Without it, references into the library stay unresolved: harmless until you read
one, then `UnresolvedReferenceException`. (`ToolkitBackend.Open("a.sysml", "b.sysml")` and
`ToolkitBackend.OpenSources(sources)` open without it.) Relative paths are relative to the working
directory. Element ids depend on the file names given. With sources given, paths are ignored.

A payload refers to the standard library's elements without containing them; pass the library JSON
and those references resolve. Library elements are not the model's (`All()`, `Roots()`,
`ElementsOfType<T>()` skip them); a qualified name is looked up in the payload first. The library
JSON lists each library element's own members only, not what it inherits.

## The shape of the API

- **Find:** `model.Resolve("Pkg::Part::feature")` returns `IElement?`: cast it
  (`(PartDefinition)model.Resolve(...)!`). `model.ElementsOfType<PartUsage>()` (subclasses
  included), `model.All()`, `model.Roots()` (top-level namespaces; the packages are their
  `ownedMember`). `model.Resolve` is the SysML Toolkit's own name lookup: it also finds inherited
  members and members of a feature's type (`"EBikes::CargoEBike::wheels"` is `Bike::wheels`), and it
  answers where the specification's `resolve` operation is refused.
- **Properties** keep the specification name, lower camel case: `el.qualifiedName`,
  `el.ownedFeature`; C# keywords are escaped (`operation.@operator`). **Operations** are methods:
  `el.effectiveName()`, `ns.resolve("Name")`; one sharing a property's name takes `Op`:
  `instantiatedTypeOp()`. Runtime members are PascalCase: `ElementId`, `MetaclassName`, `Handle`,
  `Model`, `GetRaw(prop)`.
- **Members are default interface members:** they are visible only through a variable typed as an
  interface that declares them. Keep variables typed as the metaclass (`PartUsage p`), not as a class
  or `object`.
- **Metaclass tests:** `el is PartUsage p`, `OfType<PartUsage>()`. `ConnectionUsage`,
  `InterfaceUsage` and `AllocationUsage` are `PartUsage`s too (`FlowUsage` is not); every connector,
  connections, flows, successions and bindings alike, is a `ConnectorAsUsage`. A definition's
  `ownedPart` therefore lists its connections too.
- **Every element** (`IElement`) has the members of `Element`: `name`, `declaredName`,
  `qualifiedName`, `owner`, `owningNamespace`, `documentation`, `isLibraryElement`,
  `effectiveName()`.
- **Values:** multi-valued properties are `IReadOnlyList<T>` (empty when absent); single-valued ones
  nullable: `bool?` (test `== true`), `long?` for Integer, `double?` for Real, `string?` (enumeration
  values are lowercase strings: `"requirement"`). `sourceFeature` is one feature, `targetFeature` a
  list. An unnamed element has `name` null.
- **Identity:** within one model, `Equals`/`GetHashCode` go by element id, so elements work in
  `HashSet`/`Dictionary`. The same element read through two models (the SysML Toolkit's and its
  export's) is not `Equals`: compare their `ElementId`s.
- **Errors:** `NotImplementedInToolkitException`, `UnresolvedReferenceException`, `GoneException`,
  all `SdkException`s. An operation argument that must be an element and is null throws
  `ArgumentException`.
- **Operations** need the SysML Toolkit (a payload throws for every one) and take the
  specification's parameters in order, as the interfaces declare them
  (`inheritedMemberships(excludedNamespaces, excludedTypes, excludeImplied)`). The SysML Toolkit has
  a body for about a third of them and answers a call only where its evidence for the model is
  complete. Answered on a typical model: `effectiveName()` (not on every unnamed feature),
  `effectiveShortName()`, `resolveGlobal`, `supertypes(true)` (the argument is `excludeImplied`),
  `evaluate(target)` (target: the element to evaluate in, such as the part usage, never null; it
  returns elements, such as the literal a feature is bound to), `modelLevelEvaluable`. Refused
  there: `resolve`, `resolveLocal`, `resolveVisible`, `visibleMemberships`, `namesOf`,
  `inheritedMemberships`, `supertypes(false)`. No body at all: `isCompatibleWith`, `specializes`,
  `allSupertypes`, `directionOf`, ... Catch the refusal.

## When the SysML Toolkit refuses a read (read this before writing queries)

The SysML Toolkit's checked reader answers a property only where it can derive it completely. In
this release it refuses most of what builds on inheritance, so plan for it:

- **refused on nearly every element:** `feature`, `inheritedFeature`, `inheritedMembership`,
  `featureMembership`, `member`, `membership`, `importedMembership`, `endFeature`, `input`,
  `output`, `usage`, `directedUsage`, `definition` and the kind-specific definitions
  (`partDefinition`, `portDefinition`, `itemDefinition`, `requirementDefinition`, ...),
  `parameter` and `featuringType`;
- **refused on features, even with a written typing:** `type`. Assume it is refused and use
  `TypesOf` below;
- **refused on connectors, accept actions, requirements and satisfy relations:** `sourceFeature`,
  `targetFeature`, `connectorEnd`, `relatedFeature`, `payloadParameter`, `subjectParameter`,
  `actorParameter`, `stakeholderParameter`, `satisfyingFeature`;
- **answered:** what the model states itself: `ownedMember`, `ownedFeature`, `ownedMembership`, the
  owned lists (`ownedUsage`, `ownedPart`, `nestedUsage`, `nestedPart`, `nestedAttribute`,
  `nestedState`, `nestedTransition`, ...; owned members only, so an empty `nestedPart` does not mean
  a usage has no parts), `owner`, `owningNamespace`, `owningType`, `name`, `declaredName`,
  `qualifiedName`, `documentation`, `multiplicity`, `direction`, `isComposite`, `isEnd`,
  `isImplied`, `entryAction`, `isParallel`, `triggerAction`, a transition's `source` and `target`,
  `satisfiedRequirement`, `chainingFeature`, and the specific owned relationships with their ends:
  `ownedTyping` (`type`), `ownedSubclassification` (`superclassifier`), `ownedSpecialization`
  (`general`), `ownedSubsetting` (`subsettedFeature`; it holds the redefinitions too),
  `ownedRedefinition` (`redefinedFeature`), `ownedReferenceSubsetting` (`referencedFeature`), and a
  port definition's `conjugatedPortDefinition` / `originalPortDefinition`. (`ownedMember`,
  `ownedFeature` and `ownedMembership` are refused on a `FeatureReferenceExpression`.)

The refusal's message names the member and the SysML Toolkit's reason (`property has an incomplete
derivation`, `Type features are incomplete: IncompleteProvider`, `incomplete operation evidence`):
the SysML Toolkit lacks complete evidence for that element, which says nothing about whether the
model is right. Whether a read is refused depends on the property and the element; try one element
first rather than assume. Where it is refused, in this order:

**1. Read what the model states.** The helpers below derive what the common refused properties
give, from the owned relationships (verified through the SysML Toolkit and through the export alike;
copy them as they are: static local functions in a top-level program, or static methods of a class).
`isImplied` marks the relationships the SysML Toolkit adds from the library, which the model does
not write.

// redefinitions too; isImplied marks what the SysML Toolkit adds from the library).

}
```

**2. Query the SysML Toolkit's export as a payload** when a question needs the specification's full
derivation across a whole model (inherited members with visibility and imports, connector ends of
library connections). The export is written by the SysML Toolkit's compatibility path: it carries a
value for every property, including the ones the checked reader refuses, which the SysML Toolkit
does not vouch for. Say so in your answer when the result depends on them.

```csharp
var library = PayloadLibrary.FromJson(File.ReadAllText("sysml.library.full.json"));  // once
var exported = Model.FromFullJson(toolkit.FullJson(), library);   // same element ids as the SysML Toolkit's
```

**3. Never** substitute an empty list, a guess or a default for a refused read.

## Navigation recipes

With the helpers above; each works through the SysML Toolkit and on a payload.

```csharp
// d, part, port, usage, flow, machine and constraint stand for elements you have at hand (d: a
// definition or usage, as a SpecType); model is the Model.

// Parts of a definition or usage, owned and inherited, not connections; the model's own, not the
// library's (start, done, subparts, ...)
var parts = FeaturesWithInherited(d).OfType<PartUsage>().Where(p => p is not ConnectionUsage).ToList();

var definitions = TypesOf(part);                       // what a usage is typed by

// The value a feature has in a context (`attribute :>> mass = 2.5;` in the part's definition or body)
var massF = (Feature)model.Resolve("Pkg::Component::mass")!;   // the declaration; DeclarationOf(f) finds it from a redefinition
var expr = BoundValue(part, massF);                    // an Expression, or null
var mass = Number(expr!);                             // a literal, or a sign applied to one (-40.0)

var (lower, upper) = MultiplicityOf(usage);            // (2, 2) for [2]; (1, 1) by default; upper null for *
var text = lower == upper ? $"[{lower}]" : $"[{lower}..{(upper is null ? "*" : upper.ToString())}]";

// Roll-up: an attribute summed over a definition's direct parts (mass, cost, power); for a deeper
// tree, apply it to each part that has parts of its own (FeaturesWithInherited(p))
double total = 0;
var missing = new List<string?>();
foreach (var p in parts)
{
    var e = BoundValue(p, massF);
    var (lo, hi) = MultiplicityOf(p);
    if (e is null || hi is null || lo != hi) missing.Add(p.name);   // no value, or a range ([4..6], *): report, never guess
    else total += Number(e) * lo!.Value;
}

// Ports: the definition, and whether it is conjugated (`port p : ~PowerPort;`). portDefinition
// (a list) is refused; isConjugated is false on a `~` port: the conjugation is its type, the
// ConjugatedPortDefinition that PowerPort owns (name "~PowerPort", qualified name

    Console.WriteLine(t is ConjugatedPortDefinition c ? "~" + c.originalPortDefinition!.qualifiedName : t.qualifiedName);

// Connections (ConnectionUsage: connect, interfaces, allocations): the ends, the source first. The
// ends of an inherited connection are the supertype's features (Drone::rotors, not a redefining
// `part :>> rotors[8];`): FeatureIn(d, PathOf(end)[0]) is the one that stands for it in d
foreach (var c in FeaturesWithInherited(d).OfType<ConnectionUsage>())
{
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(" -> ", Ends(c).Select(e => string.Join(".", PathOf(e).Select(f => f.name)))));
    var portTypes = Ends(c).Select(e => TypesOf(PathOf(e)[^1])).ToList();   // per end: [PortDefinition or ConjugatedPortDefinition]
}
// Flows (FlowUsage), bindings (BindingConnectorAsUsage) and successions are ConnectorAsUsage too,
// with the same Ends()
var items = ((FlowUsage)flow).payloadType;             // the flowing item's definition

// States
var machine = (StateUsage)model.Resolve("Pkg::Controller::modes")!;   // e.g. an ExhibitStateUsage
var states = machine.nestedState;                      // its own states
var initial = InitialStates(machine);                  // `entry; then off;`, `first start then off;`, ...
var reachable = ReachableStates(machine);              // from the initial states along the transitions
foreach (var t in machine.nestedTransition)            // t.guardExpression
{
    ActionUsage from = t.source!, to = t.target!;      // the states (cast to StateUsage); an initial

## Multiplicity

`multiplicity` is only what the usage itself declares; `MultiplicityOf` above applies SysML's rule:
a usage without one takes the multiplicity of the features it redefines or subsets as written
(nearest first; `part :>> battery[2];` declares its own), and one that redefines or subsets nothing
is `[1..1]` if it is an attribute, item, part or port usage owned by a definition or usage, and
unconstrained (`[0..*]`) otherwise. Implied subsettings (`isImplied`, such as every part's
subsetting of the library's `parts`) do not count. A bound may be an expression to evaluate in
context (`Rotor[rotorCount]`); `Bounds` throws for it.

## Evaluating the model's expressions

Expressions are elements: `OperatorExpression` (`@operator` such as `"<="`, `"and"`, `"not"`;
`argument`), `FeatureReferenceExpression` (`referent`), `FeatureChainExpression` (`a.b`:
`argument[0]` is `a`, `targetFeature` is `b`; it is an OperatorExpression too, so match it first),
literals with `value` (`LiteralInteger` `long?`, `LiteralRational` `double?`, `LiteralBoolean`,
`LiteralString`, `LiteralInfinity` for `*`), `TriggerInvocationExpression` (`kind`: `at`, `after`,
`when`). An enumeration literal is an `EnumerationUsage` whose `owningNamespace` is the
`EnumerationDefinition` (its `owningType` is null, by the specification). Through the SysML Toolkit,
`argument` is refused: an expression's operands are its `ownedFeature`s, each bound by a
`FeatureValue` in its `ownedMembership`.

The SysML Toolkit's `evaluate(target)` operation evaluates some expressions (it returns elements);
beyond that, the SDK does not evaluate. The SDK's source repository
(https://github.com/Open-MBEE/sysml-sdk, not the release packages) has, in
`examples/queries/csharp/Queries.cs`, an evaluator in three-valued logic and complete queries:
reachable states with shortest trigger sequences, bill of materials, attribute roll-up,
connectivity, requirement checks. Where it is at hand, start from it for such questions; the recipes
above cover the simple cases.

## Other differences from the specification

- **With the library loaded**, `usage`/`feature` (in a payload) include library features: filter
  with `isLibraryElement`. A flow's `connectorEnd` also lists the library flow's ends; use `Ends`.
- The second operand of `and`/`or`/`implies` is the operand expression itself, not the
  `FeatureReferenceExpression` to it that the specification builds. Accept both.
- An unnamed `satisfy` has no `name`, but a qualified-name lookup may still find it under the name
  of the requirement it satisfies. A feature named only through what it redefines has `name` from it
  and `declaredName` null (a satisfy's subject parameter is named `subj`, although it redefines the
  subject of the requirement's definition).
- `mayTimeVary`, `isVariable` and `isConstant` on usages throw `NotImplementedInToolkitException`.
- In the SysML Toolkit's export, an alias (`alias ax for x;`) hides the membership of the feature it
  names from what specializations inherit, and a conjugated port's `portDefinition` is the
  `ConjugatedPortDefinition` (`~PowerPort`), as the specification says.
- A payload answers what its writer wrote: stand-ins where the writer had no value (null, `false`,
  an empty list), and `UnresolvedReferenceException` for references
  into the standard library unless it was given the library JSON.

## Verify

- Run the same query through the SysML Toolkit (with the helpers) and on its export as a payload
  (the plain derived properties), matching elements by `ElementId`; differences point at the
  SysML Toolkit, the export, or your code.
- Format with `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` and sort names with `StringComparer.Ordinal`, so output
  does not depend on the machine's culture.
- For more examples: the guide and runnable tutorial (`examples/csharp/`) and the query examples
  (`examples/queries/csharp/`) in the SDK repository.
